#### Objective  
- Implemented a word recognition experiment to determine whether non-words are recognized more slowly than words  
- Accurately estimated Posterior Probability Distribution Parameters using Non-Analytical Bayesian Models  

---

#### Approach  
- Performed Prior Predictive Checks by sampling over 10,000 instances from Lexical-Access and Null Hypothesis Models  
- Estimated posterior distributions using:  
  - Markov Chains  
  - Monte Carlo Integration  
  - Grid Estimation  
  - Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC)  

---

#### Impact  
- Successfully validated the Lexical-Access Model with a narrow 95% credible interval under 4 milliseconds  
- Achieved 99.85% accurate mean estimates and 70.2% accurate standard deviation estimates relative to true values using Monte Carlo methods
